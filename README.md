# MoodWorks
Summary:

A year in pixels is a new form of the Likert scale, a scale that ranges from 1-5 which is used to allow an individual to express how much they agree or disagree with a particular statement. 

We have taken a modern and more appealing approach by allowing the user to capture and document their day and mood by the use of color. An attractive and interactive system allows the user to get a greater sense of their mental health.

Generally, your average mood per day gets overlooked, with our app you will be able to go in-depth and get a good idea of your mental health, and this might even allow the auxiliary health system (psychiatrists, therapists, etc.) to help their patients in a new way whereby they can talk about their week in a deeper sense.

Project Purpose and Description:

A year in pixels is a yearlong mood and metal health tracker, not only giving the user an easy way to understand their mood patterns and mental states but also providing tips, tricks, and helpful resources to help those of us that need some help now and again.

This project was created to analyze the moods of the users. The “mood” along with other information is taken daily and analyzed to help users understand what their moods are at certain times along with tips and tricks to help you understand what is happening and tips on how to handle those emotions and keep yourself happy. 

Each user can go back and see their mood history and at what times which moods occurred. This will help users and psychiatrists if needed to analyze the moods of the users. A year in pixels is an interactive way to visually track your mental state and moods over a year and see what made you feel the way you do, it allows people to help themselves, by themselves in their way. 

Our goal is to have a fully functioning application on the respective app stores and have it certified as an aid for psychologists, physiatrists and therapists to help with treatment because they can’t always be there. The impact of an application like this may be big, people may be proud of the pixel “art” that they created and may also be proud of their progress and post it online, reaching even more.
